### React Commons Collection
React Commons Collection is the most generic form of React web components which can be transformed into any design specifications, required by your next project.

The general motivation involved in building this library from the ground zero is to create design-less React web components, which could then we extended upon to build anything specific to the project requirements and custom use cases.

Although, there are a ton of popular React UI libraries available, but my intention was to build set of React Commons component collection which can be customized however you need to for your project requirements.

#### Baked Responsiveness
React Commons Collection library comes with built in responsive feature of responsive for each element right into it's core. Following is the sample code to use the responsive feature of any React Commons Component.

```javascript
  <H1
    color='#FFFFFF'
    desktop=''
    fontFamily='Playfair Display'
    fontSize='2em'
    fontWeight={700}
    laptop=''
    laptopL=''
    letterSpacing="1px"
    lineHeight="normal"
    mobileL=''
    mobileM=''
    mobileS=''
    tablet=''
    textAlign="center"
    textTransform="uppercase"
  >
    H1 Component
  </H1>
```

Checkout the above sample H1 code, `desktop`, `laptop`, `laptopL`, `mobileL`, `mobileM`, `mobileS`, `tablet` are optional props that will manage the responsiveness of this component on each of these breakpoints with the help of underlying mechanics.

Imagine if we need to change color of H1 on `desktop` size screen, I'd leverage it's `desktop` props by doing so:

```javascript
  <H1
    color='#FFFFFF'
    desktop={`
      color: 'red;
    `}
    fontFamily='Playfair Display'
    fontSize='2em'
    fontWeight={700}
    laptop=''
    laptopL=''
    letterSpacing="1px"
    lineHeight="normal"
    mobileL=''
    mobileM=''
    mobileS=''
    tablet=''
    textAlign="center"
    textTransform="uppercase"
  >
    H1 Component
  </H1>
```

Notice, we just passed the stringified CSS to the concerned props to manage our responsive code for each of these components, this is how simple it is to manage the responsive of each components as per your needs.

#### Baked Theme
By leveraging `StyledComponents` built-in theme support has been configured throughout React Commons Components and all of it's extensions too.

Theme is a massive object that holds a ton of properties categories under various sections, following is the interface to put things into perspective.

```typescript
  interface ITheme {
    avatarSizes : IAvatarSizes;
    breakpoints : IBreakpoints;
    colors : IColors;
    misc : IMisc;
    radius : IRadius;
    shadow : IShadow;
    spacing : ISpacing;
    typography : ITypography;
    zIndex : IZindex;
  }
```

### React UI Collection
React UI Collection is an extension of React Commons Collection, building project specific UI/UX on generic components. There are two fully functional apps built on this library;

An e-commerce and developer portfolio app ware built using React Commons Collection components, cutting the development overheads and making sure to enable same coding standards and practices across all projects.

This approach helped a lot to write good standard, robust and maintainable code, single handedly.

### React Icon Collection
React Icon Collection is an extension of React Commons Collection, this library contains 1000's of React SVG components of icons, making is so convenient for developers to take the pain out of using SVG with React. Following is the sample code to get started with it.

```javascript
  import { FourthofjulyGrey12 } from '@react-pakistan/react-icons-collection/fourthofjuly-grey';

  <FourthofjulyGrey12
    fontSize="32px"
    fill="#2E2E2E"
  />
```

### React Logo Collection
Same as React Icon Collection, but only difference it has is that it contains several logos. Following is the sample code to get started with it.

```javascript
  import { BitcoinColor22 } from '@react-pakistan/react-logo-collection/logos/bitcoin-color';

  <BitcoinColor22
    fontSize="32px"
    color="#2E2E2E"
  />
```

### React Emojis Collection
Same as React Icon Collection, but only difference it has is that it contains 1000's of emojis. Following is the sample code to get started with it.

```javascript
  import { BodyParts1 } from '@react-pakistan/react-logo-collection/emoji/body-parts';

  <BodyParts1
    fontSize="32px"
  />
```
